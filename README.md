# Ossia Link Budget Tool

This project was created by Jason Feuerstein in January 2021.

## Overview

- `App.js` is the main app component, serving as the parent for all other components.
- `2.4GHz.js` and `5.8GHz.js` contain inputs, graphs, and tables for both 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz Cota systems.
- `Measured.js` contains the "Measured 2.4 to 5.8 GHz" feature.

## Admin Mode

- Admin mode allows for full control of input parameters.
- Enter admin mode by opening "Settings" then inputting the Admin Key.

## Changing Table/Graph Domain

- To adjust the domain of the tables/graphs, first locate the `meters` array and add/remove input values accordingly.
- Next, locate the `graphData` array and modify it to account for the new input values.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
